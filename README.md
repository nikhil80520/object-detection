# Sign Language Detection with YOLOv5 ðŸš€

Overview
This project focuses on real-time sign language detection using the YOLOv5 object detection model. By leveraging a robust dataset annotated with Roboflow, the model can detect and classify various sign language gestures, providing a helpful tool for sign language interpretation.

Key Features
Real-Time Detection: Efficient and fast detection of sign language gestures using YOLOv5.
Custom Annotations: The dataset was custom-annotated using Roboflow for accuracy and precision.
Versatile Application: Can be integrated into applications for accessibility, communication, or learning purposes.
Dataset and Annotations
The dataset for sign language gestures was collected and annotated using Roboflow.
The dataset includes [number of classes] sign language gestures such as [list some gestures] to cover a range of basic communication gestures.
Roboflow was used to streamline the annotation process and augment the dataset for better performance.

Model Architecture
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) is an advanced object detection model that runs efficiently in real-time, suitable for tasks requiring fast detection without compromising accuracy.

Why YOLOv5?
Speed: Capable of real-time detection, making it ideal for gesture recognition.
Accuracy: Offers state-of-the-art performance for object detection tasks.
Flexibility: Easy to fine-tune for specific datasets like sign language.
